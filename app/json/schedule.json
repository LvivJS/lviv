Once more, it’s fallen on the head of the trusty, multiple-hat-wearing web designer to become a social engineer. In addition to everything else we do, it’s now our job to design strategies and integrate them into our projects. It’s not just about connecting these services to our apps or websites. It’s about knowing how to craft together behaviors, user experience, and traditional design elements in a beautifully harmonious way that achieves business goals. From lessons learned while designing a large social network from scratch, and minus the overly familiar buzzwords and marketing cliches, Sarah will teach you how to truly engage with your users. Discover the real value of social media reciprocity, and learn how to make it work for you. "

Even if we do need fallbacks for older browsers, modern tools make it easy. This makes now the perfect time to learn about SVG and how it can help you in everyday web design. Perhaps the most compelling reason: SVG images look sharp at any dimension with tiny file sizes—which is great for making responsive websites responsibly. You’ll also learn how SVG helps to easily create complex shapes, and how to use it to make icons that are more accessible than with any other web-based icon creation technique. You’ll learn how SVG can make customized complex graphics on the fly, create compelling animations and other interactions, and empower some pretty great designerly effects."

In this talk, Eric will draw on his personal and professional experience to explore examples of crisis-mitigating design successes and failures. In the process, he'll illustrate ways that you can and should consider the needs of users teetering on the edge of panic. Helping them will make your designs more relevant and useful for all your users."
